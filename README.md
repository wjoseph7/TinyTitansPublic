# Motivation

I started this project after reading several finance books that advocate for 
value investing. These include Investing at Level III by James Cloonan and 
then What Works on Wallstreet and Predicting the Markets of Tomorrow by James 
O'Shaughnessy. 

In O'Shaughnessy's book the strategy with the largest long term returns was a
micro-cap strategy called Tiny Titans (TT). I wanted to see if I could recreate 
these results myself and compare the robustness of TT to other benchmarks,
especially to see how it compares when you factor taxes in. 

# The Tiny Titans Strategy

TT is a simple 3-step strategy:

1. Consider only stocks with a market cap between 25 and 250 million
2. Eliminate the stocks with a price-to-sales ratio greater than 1
3. Rank the stocks by 1-year price appreciation
4. Invest in the top 25 stocks on the list equally
5. Repeat the process annually

Now the annual cycle was chosen mostly because of a limitation of the software
O'Shaughnessy was using. The American Association of Individual Investors 
website has a benchmark using a monthly cycle instead (which does even better).
So I opted to replicate that.
